            <h2>What is telemedicine?</h2>
            <p>Telemedicine allows you to discuss non-emergency medical issues with a doctor by phone or online at a time that's convenient for you.

                Telemedicine offers access to licensed medical professionals for people who may not have access otherwise. It often provides lower costs for services.

                It also can be a cost-effective way for people who do not have insurance, or whose insurance does not cover certain costs, to get care.

                Though telemedicine can be beneficial for a number of reasons, it should not replace in-person doctor visits.

                It's important to keep in mind that telemedicine healthcare professionals do not have the ability to take your blood or urine samples, heart rate, blood pressure, or other important medical tests. For example, with the lack of physical touch in telemedicine, the results of a physical exam could be greatly hampered.</p>
            <h2>Who should use telemedicine?</h2>
            <p>Telemedicine is great and very convenient for anyone with a busy job, hectic life, or otherwise jam-packed schedule.

                Attending an appointment virtually at home or your office can make all the difference in needing to find and pay for child care or taking time off of work.

                Plus, it's a great option for people who may not otherwise have access to certain physicians or physician types, or who cannot afford, or prefer not to pay, the price of standard medical visits.

                Additionally, people who are immunocompromised or who have underlying health conditions could be at greater risk when in a doctor's office.

                Telemedicine is also a very accessible way to see a physician for certain purposes, like refilling a prescription or sharing preliminary information, checking symptoms, or bringing up concerns about a health issue that does not require a physical examination.

                This is especially true for people with disabilities or who have limitations getting around physically, or those who are geographically isolated or incarceratedTrusted Source.

                That said, telemedicine is inaccessible to anyone without regular computer or smartphone access or a reliable internet connection. It's also important to keep in mind that there can be safety concerns, both physical and otherwise, when you have the ability to be on the go. Driving while taking a telemedicine appointment is not recommended at all — both tasks require your full attention, and it would be better if you were in a safe space to take your appointment.

                While telemedicine makes appointments easier and more mobile, be careful not to take your appointment in public places, as privacy could be an issue. Whether it's privacy concerns regarding the internet, or how much you say in a public space, it's safer for you to talk to your doctor in a secluded, secure space for you to discuss any concerns you have openly without an audience.</p>
